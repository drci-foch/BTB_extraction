# Transbronchial Biopsy Document Extractor

## Overview

This repository contains the development version of the Transbronchial Biopsy Document Extractor, a tool designed to automate the extraction of information from non-structured or semi-structured documents of transbronchial biopsies. Leveraging a combination of regular expressions (regex) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this tool aims to streamline the processing of biopsy reports by extracting key data points, such as patient information, biopsy findings, creation of variables and diagnostic conclusions.

## Features

- **Regex Patterns**: Custom regex patterns are used to identify and extract standardized information from the text, such as patient IDs, dates, and specific medical terminology related to transbronchial biopsies.
- **NLP Analysis**: Utilizes NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for more sophisticated analysis, including entity recognition, to extract and categorize non-standardized or narrative text data.
- **Data Normalization**: Converts extracted information into a structured format, facilitating easier integration with databases and further analysis.
- **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms to handle and log errors or anomalies in document formats, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- **Work in Progress**: Ongoing efforts to improve extraction accuracy, expand the range of document types processed, and refine the user interface for easier use by medical professionals and researchers.
